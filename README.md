# 👋 Hello, I'm Magnus Moen

🎓 **NTNU Gjøvik, Class of 2023**  
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Web Development from NTNU Gjøvik. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in web technologies, focusing on front-end development and sustainable web design.

💻 **Full-time Developer in Oslo**  
Currently, I'm working as a full-time developer in Oslo, where I continue to hone my skills and contribute to exciting projects. My work primarily revolves around front-end development, where I strive to create efficient, user-friendly, and sustainable web solutions.

🌍 **Passionate About Sustainable Web Design**  
I'm particularly interested in how we can build websites that are not only functional but also environmentally responsible. Sustainable web design is key to reducing the carbon footprint of the web, and I'm always looking for new ways to integrate these principles into my work.

🚀 **Continuous Learning and Development**
I'm actively expanding my skill set by exploring DevOps practices, building full-stack Web APIs, and deepening my knowledge of front-end frameworks like Next.js and .NET. 

🌱 **Always Curious**  
My passion for front-end development drives me to stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in the industry.
